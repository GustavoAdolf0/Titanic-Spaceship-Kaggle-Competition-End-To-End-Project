# Titanic-Spaceship-Kaggle-Competition-End-To-End-Project



Predicting Spaceship Titanic Passenger's Transport with Machine Learning
Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately predicting passenger transport based on various features such as age, gender, class, fare, etc.

# Methodology
The project methodology involves the following steps:

Exploring the dataset and performing data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
Selecting and training various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting.
Evaluating model performance using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
Tuning hyperparameters of the best models using techniques like grid search or random search.
Selecting the best model and making predictions on a test set.
Expected Results
We anticipate achieving an accuracy of at least 80% on the test set, indicating the reliability of our machine learning model in predicting Titanic passenger transport. Additionally, we will analyze feature importance to gain insights into the factors influencing passenger survival.

# Conclusion
This project underscores the effectiveness of machine learning in analyzing historical data and predicting outcomes. Furthermore, it pays tribute to the tragedy of the Titanic while honoring the memories of the passengers and crew who lost their lives.
